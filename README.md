# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Communication-and-Translation-Application-for-Deaf-and-Mute-Individuals.
The project titled "Realtime Sign Language Communication and Translation Application for Deaf and Mute Individuals" focuses on developing an intelligent and accessible mobile application that enables real-time bidirectional communication between hearing individuals and those who are deaf or mute, using Indian Sign Language (ISL). The system uses deep learning-based gesture recognition and natural language processing to interpret hand signs into text, and typed language into ISL visual representations.
The system architecture integrates computer vision and language processing components. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) processes live camera input to detect and classify hand gestures into corresponding ISL signs, while a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network handles the sequential processing of text input for accurate language-to-sign translation. The application supports both gesture-to-text and text-to-sign pathways. MediaPipe and OpenCV are employed for real-time hand tracking and gesture landmark detection, ensuring high accuracy and low latency.
The solution is implemented as a full-featured Android application using Android Studio. It incorporates Firebase Authentication for secure user access, Google’s TTS for text interaction, and pre-trained deep learning models for gesture recognition. The interface allows users to register or log in, interpret ISL signs via camera, input text, and receive real-time translations through on-screen text or ISL animations.
With applications in inclusive communication, assistive technology, education, and accessibility services, this project offers an effective and scalable solution to bridge the communication divide for the deaf and mute community.
